# This changelog is only to document changes in pricing or features

## 10.2020

* General:
    - Moved from Node.js to Jekyll, so I can use GitHub pages.


## 10.2019
* Domains:
    - Namecheap: first registration of .io domain went down from $29.88 to $25.88 (renewal price stays the same). .pizza domain price went up from $39.88 to $44.88. Right now, Namecheap has a birthday sales, so many domains are discounted (e.g. you can grab a .pizza domain for $6.88 - but only for the first year.)
    - Namesilo: .org domain now costs $8.88 for the first year only and .pizza costs $6.36 for the first year; .io domain price went down from $35.99 to $32.88.
    - Adds information about Google Domains in the "Personal recommendation" section. Since Google Domains is only available in some countries (15 countries as of 25.10.2019), I'm not adding it to the comparison on the page.
* SSL certificates:
    - Remove information about EV Certificates as they are no longer supported by the browsers.
* Uptime monitoring:
    - StatusCake: Monitoring interval went down from 15 to 5 minutes for the free plan.
* CDN:
    - KeyCDN: Transfer got cheaper for South Africa and South America
    - CDN77: Minimum recharge went up from $149 to $199
* Emails:
    - Mailchimp: Free tier now only allows 10k emails instead of 12k per month
* CI:
    - CircleCI and Codeship changed their plans to "credit based" (you pay some credits for your builds, depending on what type of machine you are using)
* VC:
    - GitHub private repositories are now free


## 10.2018
* Hosting
    - Updated prices for DigitalOcean, Linode and Amazon Lightsail. They all offer more resources - more RAM or disk space for the same price (and some of the changes are quite impressive - for example DigitalOcean doubled the amount of RAM in each plan).
    - Added GCE to the free tier. They offer a small f1-micro machine for free forever - it's more than enough to run a website with a small traffic.
    - Amazon Lightsail offers now a $3.5 plan with 512 MB of RAM, 1 CPU, 20 GB SSD and 1 TB of transfer (not mentioned on DeployStack website, but I thought that maybe you want to know).
    - For $15 DigitalOcean offers 3 different configurations (3 GB RAM and 1 CPU / 2 GB RAM and 2 CPUs / 1 GB RAM and 3 CPUs), which can give you some nice flexibility - if you are running one of those configurations and you notice that you are not using much of the CPU but a lot of RAM, you can easily switch the instance to a more suitable configuration (here is how you can switch from one type of VM to another: https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/how-to/migrate-droplets/).
* Domains
    - Namecheap and Namesilo are currently running sales on many of their domains where the first time registration is cheaper (around $2 cheaper for the most popular domains like .com, .org, but even up to $30 cheaper for domains like .pizza), which is a pretty nice deal if you are thinking about buying a domain now.
    - Namecheap has slightly increased the prices of their domains (from $0.50 for the most popular domain up to $2 for less popular ones).
    - Exactly the next day after I updated the information about 1&1, they rebranded to ionos and changed prices (well, they actually changed everything - the name, business model, their website, etc.), so I had to update the information again ðŸ˜•.
* Monitoring
    - Both UptimeRobot and StatusCake improved their paid SMS credits offers (UptimeRobot doubled the amount of SMS and StatusCake halved their prices).
    - Added information about status pages (free for UptimeRobot and paid for StatusCake).
* Files storage
    - AWS S3 glacier storage is now cheaper (around $0.004-0.005 per GB/month, comparing to $0.007-0.012 that was before).
* CDN
    - AWS Cloudfront now has 132 Points of Presence (up from 87).
    - MaxCDN has been acquired by StackPath and since I couldn't find a good replacement for it, I have limited the "Monthly plans" section to only CloudFlare. While reviewing the available CDN services, I have extended the "Pay as you go" section to also include the KeyCDN (that has a slightly cheaper prices than CDN77 and requires lower yearly recharge than CDN77).
* Errors
    - Sentry decreased the amount of errors per month in the "free plan", but at the same time they increased the log retention from 7 to 30 days.
    - Rollbar slightly decreased the price of the paid plan (from $49 to $41).
    - Airbrake has removed their hidden free plan (that was before available under https://airbrake.io/account/new/free URL), so I have removed the Airbrake from the list.
* Emails
    - Both Mailchimp and SendinBlue provide "automation" emails that allow you to automate your workflows based on users' actions (a welcome email, a mini tutorial split into 5 emails, etc.).
    - While SendinBlue support only 300 emails sent per day, which might be a problem if you have more than 300 people on your mailing list, they also have a Reque feature (https://help.sendinblue.com/hc/en-us/articles/209421725-What-does-the-Requeue-feature-do-), that will allow you to continue sending the emails to your mailing list on the next day (when your daily emails quota is renewed).
    - Mailgun offers a 100 validations for free every month (so you can verify that an email actually exists) and two types of plans: monthly plans or "pay as you go".
* Static websites
    - Surge now offers a professional plan for $30/month, where you can have unlimited number of projects (previously it was $13/month per project).
